# League Rules
## LEAGUE STRUCTURE
- Teams shall be arranged in Divisions, up to a maximum of six teams in each
Division, at the Annual General Meeting.
- At the end of the season the top two teams in a Division shall be promoted
and the bottom two teams relegated (see 5c).
- The two teams finishing at the bottom of the lowest Division should apply for
re-election at the AGM along with any new applicants.
- No club shall have more than 2 teams in Division 1.
- A team that continues to provide only 1 pair without explanation on the result
sheet shall be investigated by the Executive Committee for any action
deemed necessary by them.
## ELIGIBILITY OF PLAYERS
- All players must be members of the club that they represent on a permanent
basis, ie membership without limitation to a period of the season.
- Additional players may be registered during the course of the season and are
eligible to play once the League Secretary acknowledges their registration.
- A player may only play for one club during the course of a season.
- A player may not play in more than one match fixture for the same week, a
rearranged or postponed match shall count for the week in which it was
originally fixtured.
Contravention of this rule will cause forfeiture of the points gained in the lower
team(s) in which the player(s) played. The League Secretary shall define,
each season, which fixtures constitute the weekly grouping.
- Where a club enters two or more teams in the League they shall be identified
as “A”, “B”, “C” etc in order of merit. A player of a lower ranking team may
play a total of two matches for the higher ranking team(s) but playing a third
match will render the player ineligible to play for the lower ranking team(s).
- A team playing an unregistered or ineligible player shall forfeit any points
gained in events in which such players were involved. The points shall be
awarded to their opponents. 
## MATCH FORMAT
- One home and one away match shall be played between each team in a
Division.
- Matches will consist of four doubles events, there being four players in each
team. Each event shall be the best of three sets. The first two sets will be
tiebreak sets at 6 – 6. If the sets are shared the third set will be played as a
long tiebreak, ie the first pair to ten points or two clear points if the score
reaches 9 – 9.
- The home team shall have the choice of courts to be used and to decide if
the courts are fit to play. Where matches are scheduled for the same club on
the same evening and less than the required number of courts are fit to play
for both matches to proceed, then the match involving the higher ranked of
the home teams shall proceed.
- Where players fail to arrive in time to start their event by 6.10 pm the
opposing pair(s) may claim the first set (6 – 0). This ruling applies to the
second set from 6.30 pm. All claims must be made before their event begins.
- Where no more than one of the opposing team arrives by 7.00 pm then the
whole match shall be forfeited and the team deducted an extra five points.
## ABANDONED MATCHES
In the event of abandoned matches, where two events have not been completed,
the match shall be deemed not to have started and shall be replayed. Where at
least two events have been completed the points are awarded for those events
and then for any completed sets. 
## AWARDING OF POINTS
- A maximum of twelve points shall be awarded for each match.
- In a two set match, the winning pair shall receive two points and the losing
 pair no points. In a three set match, the winning pair shall receive two
 points and the losing pair one point. In an uncompleted match (providing
 that at least two events have been completed) one point is awarded for
 each completed set.
- The home team shall be responsible for sending the completed score
sheet, which must be signed by the representative of each team, to the
 League Secretary and shall reach the League Secretary within four days or
 postmarked within two days of the match being played. Where a score
 sheet has not reached the League Secretary within this time the home team
 shall be penalised two points.
## FIXTURE POSTPONEMENT, RE-ARRANGEMENT AND FULFILMENT
- All matches shall be played on the date on the fixture list unless both teams
agree to an earlier date. Under no circumstances except for bad weather
 shall matches be postponed until after the original fixture date. All matches
 must be played before 1st August or 15 days after the first day of the last
 scheduled week, whichever is the later date. No points will be awarded for
 matches which remain un-played by that date.
 
### FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE RULES WILL MEAN THAT THE OFFENDING TEAM LOSES THE MATCH 8 – 0.
- Any team failing to fulfil two or more fixtures shall be deemed to have
resigned from the League and shall have to re-apply for membership.
Failing to fulfil a fixture shall be either leaving a match un-played by the end
of the season or failing to put out at least one pair in a match for whatever
reason.
## LEAGUE POSITIONS
- League positions will be decided by the most points gained in matches
played before 1st August or 15 days after the first day of the last
scheduled week, whichever is the later.
- Where two teams finish equal on points at the end of the season their
 positions shall be decided by:-
    - Set difference, and if still equal by:-
    - The aggregate of the two matches between each other during
the season.
The aggregate shall be decided on events, sets, games in that order of
priority. If the teams are still equal and if the championship or promotion
or relegation is affected by the outcome then the Executive Committee
shall arrange a play-off. If more than two clubs finish equal on points and
set difference at the end of the season then their positions shall be
decided by the total aggregate of matches played between those clubs
involved during the season using the same methods as above.
